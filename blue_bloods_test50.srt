00:00:05,230 --> 00:00:07,470
...

2
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:11,510
Get out.

3
00:00:13,239 --> 00:00:14,909
Come on.

4
00:00:15,809 --> 00:00:17,015
How you doing?

5
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:18,655
Handpicked by our people in Atlanta.

6
00:00:18,679 --> 00:00:19,809
Fresh off the boat.

7
00:00:20,521 --> 00:00:21,785
Let's take a look.

8
00:00:21,809 --> 00:00:23,225
(PANTING)

9
00:00:23,249 --> 00:00:24,225
Oh.

10
00:00:24,249 --> 00:00:25,449
Nice.

11
00:00:25,884 --> 00:00:27,225
Top-of-the-line.

12
00:00:27,249 --> 00:00:30,389
This is exactly
what we were looking for.

13
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:32,430
Wow.

14
00:00:32,454 --> 00:00:34,565
Nice work. You got it, boss.

15
00:00:34,589 --> 00:00:36,997
Fence, Dolan. Get 'em into the van.

16
00:00:41,372 --> 00:00:43,018
Move it.

17
00:00:43,435 --> 00:00:45,205
Go, go.

18
00:00:46,909 --> 00:00:48,815
Please. Let me go.

19
00:00:48,839 --> 00:00:51,685
You're gonna be okay. I promise.

20
00:00:51,709 --> 00:00:54,079
Trust me. Come on.

21
00:00:57,819 --> 00:00:59,795
(INDISTINCT RADIO CHATTER)

22
00:00:59,819 --> 00:01:01,825
- What do we got?
- Vic is Nia Fox.

23
00:01:01,849 --> 00:01:03,935
BAEZ: Looks like her
husband tuned her up.

24
00:01:03,959 --> 00:01:05,435
Neighbor called it in.

25
00:01:05,459 --> 00:01:06,705
- Okay.
- Thank you.

26
00:01:06,729 --> 00:01:08,089
Mind if we have a word?

27
00:01:09,599 --> 00:01:10,835
Nia, I'm Detective Reagan,

28
00:01:10,859 --> 00:01:14,205
this is my partner Detective Baez.

29
00:01:14,229 --> 00:01:15,375
How you doing?

30
00:01:15,399 --> 00:01:16,715
This isn't necessary.

31
00:01:16,739 --> 00:01:18,445
I'm-I'm... I'm okay.

32
00:01:18,469 --> 00:01:19,909
You don't look okay.

33
00:01:20,869 --> 00:01:22,345
Your husband do this to you?

34
00:01:22,369 --> 00:01:24,485
We had an argument.

35
00:01:24,509 --> 00:01:26,055
Looks more like a fight.

36
00:01:26,079 --> 00:01:28,925
A loud enough fight
that your neighbors called 911.

37
00:01:28,949 --> 00:01:30,795
James lost his temper.

38
00:01:30,819 --> 00:01:33,195
Okay? He's-he's really a good guy.

39
00:01:33,219 --> 00:01:35,025
He ever done this to you before?

40
00:01:35,049 --> 00:01:39,705
He's... T-There's just
a lot of pressure at work.

41
00:01:39,729 --> 00:01:41,065
Where's your husband now?

42
00:01:41,089 --> 00:01:42,361
NIA: He's at work.

43
00:01:42,385 --> 00:01:44,375
But I'm not gonna press charges.

44
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:46,605
Well, we still need to speak to him.

45
00:01:46,629 --> 00:01:47,645
(EXHALES)

46
00:01:47,669 --> 00:01:48,945
DANNY: <i>James Fox.</i>

47
00:01:48,969 --> 00:01:50,875
- Yes?
- Detectives Reagan and Baez.

48
00:01:50,899 --> 00:01:52,193
You got a second to talk?

49
00:01:52,217 --> 00:01:53,485
What's this about?

50
00:01:53,509 --> 00:01:54,643
We went by your house.
