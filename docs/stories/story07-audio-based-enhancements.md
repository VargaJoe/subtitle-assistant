# Story 07 - Audio-Based Translation Enhancements

## Story Title
**Audio-Synchronized Translation and Speech Analysis**

## User Story
As a translator working with audio-visual content, I want to utilize audio analysis to improve translation quality and timing, so that I can create more natural and accurately synchronized subtitles that match speech patterns and cultural context.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Must Have
- [ ] Audio file analysis for speech timing validation
- [ ] Speaker change detection for dialogue attribution
- [ ] Speech rate analysis for subtitle length optimization
- [ ] Audio-subtitle synchronization verification

### Should Have
- [ ] Language detection from audio track
- [ ] Emotion and tone detection for translation context
- [ ] Background audio analysis (music, effects) for translation priority
- [ ] Multiple speaker identification and labeling
- [ ] Speech clarity assessment for translation confidence

### Could Have
- [ ] Automated subtitle timing adjustment based on speech
- [ ] Cultural context detection from audio cues (accents, dialects)
- [ ] Audio quality assessment affecting translation approach
- [ ] Lip-sync validation for dubbed content preparation
- [ ] Audio-based translation quality scoring

### Won't Have (This Release)
- [ ] Real-time audio processing during translation
- [ ] Video processing and visual context analysis
- [ ] Automatic speech-to-text generation
- [ ] Voice cloning or synthesis for dubbing

## Technical Requirements

### Audio Processing Pipeline
```python
class AudioAnalyzer:
    def analyze_timing(self, audio_path: str) -> AudioTimingData
    def detect_speakers(self, audio_path: str) -> List[SpeakerSegment]
    def analyze_speech_rate(self, audio_path: str) -> SpeechRateData
    def detect_language(self, audio_path: str) -> LanguageDetection

@dataclass
class AudioTimingData:
    speech_segments: List[SpeechSegment]
    silence_periods: List[SilencePeriod]
    speech_rate: float  # words per minute
    total_speech_time: timedelta

@dataclass
class SpeakerSegment:
    start_time: timedelta
    end_time: timedelta
    speaker_id: str
    confidence: float
    gender: Optional[str] = None
    estimated_age: Optional[str] = None

@dataclass
class SpeechSegment:
    start_time: timedelta
    end_time: timedelta
    confidence: float
    volume_level: float
    clarity_score: float
```

### Integration with Translation Pipeline
```python
class AudioEnhancedTranslator(SubtitleTranslator):
    def __init__(self, audio_analyzer: AudioAnalyzer):
        super().__init__()
        self.audio_analyzer = audio_analyzer
    
    def translate_with_audio_context(
        self, 
        subtitles: List[SubtitleEntry], 
        audio_path: str
    ) -> List[SubtitleEntry]:
        # Analyze audio for context
        audio_data = self.audio_analyzer.analyze_timing(audio_path)
        speakers = self.audio_analyzer.detect_speakers(audio_path)
        
        # Enhance translation with audio context
        return self._translate_with_context(subtitles, audio_data, speakers)
```

### Audio Library Dependencies
- **librosa**: Audio analysis and feature extraction
- **speechrecognition**: Language detection capabilities
- **pyaudio**: Audio file handling and processing
- **webrtcvad**: Voice activity detection
- **resemblyzer**: Speaker identification and verification

## Implementation Tasks
- [ ] Research and select audio processing libraries
- [ ] Design audio analysis data models
- [ ] Implement basic audio timing analysis
- [ ] Add speaker detection capabilities
- [ ] Create speech rate analysis functions
- [ ] Integrate audio context into translation pipeline
- [ ] Add audio-subtitle synchronization validation
- [ ] Implement language detection from audio
- [ ] Create audio quality assessment tools
- [ ] Add CLI support for audio-enhanced translation
- [ ] Develop comprehensive test suite with audio samples
- [ ] Update documentation with audio processing capabilities

### CLI Enhancements
```bash
# Audio-enhanced translation
python main.py translate input.srt --audio input.wav --speaker-detection
python main.py translate input.srt --audio input.mp3 --sync-validation

# Audio analysis only
python main.py analyze-audio input.wav --detect-speakers --timing-analysis
python main.py validate-sync input.srt input.wav --fix-timing

# Enhanced translation with audio context
python main.py translate input.srt --audio input.wav --emotion-context --speech-rate
```

### Configuration Extensions
```yaml
audio_processing:
  enabled: true
  speaker_detection: true
  emotion_analysis: false
  sync_validation: true
  
  # Audio processing settings
  sample_rate: 16000
  frame_length: 2048
  hop_length: 512
  
  # Speaker detection thresholds
  speaker_change_threshold: 0.7
  min_speaker_duration: 1.0  # seconds
  
  # Speech analysis
  silence_threshold: 0.01
  min_speech_duration: 0.5  # seconds
```

## Dependencies
- **Primary**: librosa, speechrecognition, webrtcvad
- **Secondary**: pyaudio, scipy, numpy
- **Optional**: resemblyzer (for advanced speaker ID)

## Priority
**Nice to Have** - Advanced feature that significantly enhances translation quality but requires substantial audio processing infrastructure

## Notes
- Requires audio files to be available alongside subtitle files
- Processing time will increase significantly with audio analysis
- May need GPU acceleration for real-time processing on longer content
- Consider offering both basic and advanced audio analysis modes
- Important for professional translation workflows and high-quality outputs
