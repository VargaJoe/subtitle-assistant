## Technical Debt & Improvements
*To be populated as development progresses*

## Risks & Blockers
- **Ollama Dependency**: Project relies on local Ollama installation
- **Translation Quality**: AI translation quality may vary
- **Performance**: Large subtitle files may impact processing time
- **Context Handling**: Maintaining context across subtitle boundaries

## Notes
- Project prioritizes hearing-impaired user experience
- Focus on Hungarian translation initially
- Maintain clean, modular architecture for future enhancements
- Regular testing with real subtitle files from subtitles/ directory
