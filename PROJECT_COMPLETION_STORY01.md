| **Supported Models** | Multiple Ollama models with fallback |
| **Context Window** | Configurable (default: 3 surrounding subtitles) |
| **Timeout Handling** | Configurable (default: 300 seconds) |
| **Batch Processing** | Recursive directory processing |
| **Languages** | English → Hungarian (extensible) |

## 🧪 Testing Results

### ✅ Functionality Tests
- [x] SRT parsing accuracy (timedelta format, multi-line text)
- [x] Translation quality with Hungarian OpenEuroLLM model
- [x] Context-aware translation improvements
- [x] Formality detection and appropriate language use
- [x] Batch processing with 21 Magnum P.I. episodes
- [x] Error handling and recovery mechanisms

### ✅ Real-World Validation
- **Sample Files**: Successfully translated test samples
- **Magnum P.I. Episodes**: Currently processing 21 full episodes
- **Translation Quality Examples**:
  - "Hello, how are you today?" → "Szia, hogy vagy ma?" (informal)
  - "Excuse me, buddy. You speak English?" → "Bocs, fiú. Beszél angolul?"
  - Natural Hungarian expressions vs literal translations
